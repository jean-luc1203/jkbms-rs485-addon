## 3.0.10

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements

Added a "debug" option to check whether there is communication via the IP - rs485 gateway. The information can be found in the live module log.
Don't forget to reset it to "false" once testing is complete.

## 3.0.8

## üêû Bug fixes
following the enlightened suggestion of https://github.com/lgrenetier
I have changed "node-red-dashboard": "*", to "node-red-dashboard": "3.6.3"
so that the module can be installed

## 3.0.7
change a timer for the MQTT alive

## 3.0.6

## üêû Bug fixes

- Check that MQTT is communicating with the module
I have created a Topic in the MQTT broker to confirm that the module is able to talk to the broker at. This Topic is called **JK-BMS-RS485-CAN-module** and it must be equal to **"Online"**.
You can check this with MQTTExplorer

- Checking communication with the BMS:
To check that communication with the BMS is working properly, a log is created in the module's log file. Every 30 seconds you should be able to see this type of text

```
6 Aug 18:42:13 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:42:43 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
6 Aug 18:43:13 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-2
6 Aug 18:43:43 - [warn] [function:SerialNb] BMS SerialNb: JK-Pack-1
```

## 3.0.5

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements

- Code change for "static" & "setup" frames. 
Auto-discovery sent once on module start-up.

Then only the data is sent.
This loads the MQTT broker 10x less. The acquisition time is now set at 4 seconds for 2 BMS.

- Add new topic named **BMS_1/cell_voltage_min_number** which gives the voltage of the lowest cell in the pack 



## 3.0.4
Change pickup time

## 3.0.3
Init flow variable

## 3.0.2

## üêû Bug fixes
No longer send auto-discovery topics with data frames. Send them just once at startup.
This will relieve the MQTT broker and improve the speed of data updates in HAOS.
This loads the MQTT broker 500x less

## 3.0.1

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements

**SETUP fields**

Defining the various boudary values for the BMS  **setup** variable

For the various variables, I now define realistic **min** and **max** limits, as well as the **increment/decrement step** and, if necessary, its unit.

## V3.0.0

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements
CAN bus support is now available üí´

## üìö Documentation

## 2.0.6
Change CAN flow

## 2.0.5
Change Dockerfile

## 2.0.3
Give access write to can0

## 2.0.2

## 2.0.1

## üêû Bug fixes
Correction of the use of the variable "Broadcasting"

## üìö Documentation
Added documentation on RS485 & CAN protocols for jkbms


## 2.0.0

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements
Here is the add-on's new functionality in Version 2.0

It is now possible to leave a BMS in Master mode.

This involves setting all 4 small switches to the **down** or **0000** position.
Parameters can no longer be modified in this mode !

In this configuration, the BMS will query the other BMSs if any are connected to the RS485 bus.

The BMS will then broadcast the information it has retrieved cyclically every 5 seconds. This information will be read by this add-on

## üìö Documentation

Please read the Github [README.md](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/README.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention
As a precaution, please make a backup before this update. (it can be useful)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements

- Start of BMS management in Master Bus Broadcasting mode.
- Addition of a Boolean field and creation of a specific flow to manage broadcast frames.
- Check whether you are in broadcast or full mode, with the option of modifying BMS parameters
