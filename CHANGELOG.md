## 2.0.0

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Enhancements
Here is the add-on's new functionality in Version 2.0

It is now possible to leave a BMS in Master mode.

This involves setting all 4 small switches to the **down** or **0000** position.
Parameters can no longer be modified in this mode ! 

In this configuration, the BMS will query the other BMSs if any are connected to the RS485 bus.

The BMS will then broadcast the information it has retrieved cyclically every 5 seconds. This information will be read by this add-on

## üìö Documentation

Please read the Github [README.md](https://github.com/jean-luc1203/jkbms-rs485-addon/blob/main/README.md)
